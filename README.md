### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Using the kickstarter data, we filtered the raw data to create a pivot table to clearly show relationship between the theater kickstarter campaigns and the months they were launched. The pivot table showed the outcomes of each theater campaign and the month it was launched in. The below line chart helps us visualize the relationship between outcomes and launch month. It reveals theater campaigns launched in May and June had the highest rate of success. Theater campaigns launched in November and December had the lowest success. Theater campaigns launched in May, October or July has the highest failed amount.
