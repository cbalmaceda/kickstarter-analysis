# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
To create two new analyses: outcomes based on goals and outcomes based on launch date.
### Purpose 
We used the kickstarter data to analyze the outcome of different theater campaigns based on their launched dates and their funding goals to see if there is a correlation. 

## Analysis and Challenges


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Using the kickstarter data, we filtered the raw data to create a pivot table to clearly show relationship between the theater kickstarter campaigns and the months they were launched. The pivot table showed the outcomes of each theater campaign and the month it was launched in. The below line chart helps us visualize the relationship between outcomes and launch month. It reveals theater campaigns launched in May and June had the highest rate of success. Theater campaigns launched in November and December had the lowest success. Theater campaigns launched in May, October or July has the highest failed amount.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

 We used Excel to visualize the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled plays based on the funding goal amount. We did this by using countifs functions to populate the data and used it to visualize the relationship between the goal amount ranges and the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled projects.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Some challenges of this data set are its limited knowledge of marketing, number of people involved in the campaign and economy factors. 
It would be interesting to analyze the campaign length vs outcome, location of each campaign vs. outcome and campaign launch year vs. outcome. 


## Results
Theater Outcomes by launch date: 
* The results for theater outcomes by launch date shows theater campaigns launched in May and June had the highest rate of success. Theater campaigns launched in November and December had the lowest success. 
*	Theater campaigns launched in May, October or July has the highest failed amount. 

Outcomes based on Goals:
* Campaigns with goals less than $5,000 were the most succesful. The second most successful campaigns were those with goals between $35,0000 to $39,999 and $40,000 to $44999.
